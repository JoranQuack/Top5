A high school project with simple HTML/CSS (static pages).

## Lessons Learned

As one of my first projects involving creating webpages and writing HTML and CSS, this taught me how to implement UI/UX from a concept and prototype into a real working application. As a static site, however, I didn't have any practice making a full-stack application.
